# First Things First

This mod is not to be taken seriously. This is a practice exercise I'm doing just because I love this game and got motivated to add some random stuff.

With that said, you are more than welcome to discuss new ideas or changes to my ideas, do pull requests, etc.


# Ideas 

These are ideas I want to add to the game. 

✅ Means this is already implemented

❌ Means this has not been implemented yet

### Jokers

- ❌ Auto upgrading jokers. For example, start with Bronze Joker and after a certain number of triggers of some event, auto destroys and generates the Silver Joker with better stats, which will eventually auto-upgrade to Golden Joker, etc.
- ❌ The Lighter -> _Does nothing?_
- ❌ The Torch -> _Does nothing?_ When `The Lighter` is on its left, destroy it at the end of shop and destroy `The Torch`. Generates `The Burning Torch`
- ❌ The Burning Torch -> ??? Ideas welcome :)
- ❌ The Bribe -> Sell this Joker to obtain a 50% decrease on the current Boss Blind.


### Card Effects

- ❌ Sleeved. Gives $2 at end of round. (Joker only, like `Negative`).


### Bosses

- ❌ The Hypnotizer. Forces hand to be of a certain type each time.
- ❌ The Stain. Debuffs one random card from played hand.
- ❌ The Leech. Increases blind value by 25% after each hand is played.
